# COFFEE 
Code Summary and README for the Live Project: Coffee

During the last two weeks I have been working with a team of fellow developers to create this lifestyle project that showcased different interests. It was built using the front end technologies HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and Javascript, while including JQuery, Axios, Git, and Azure Devops. Working on the front end really gave me good insights as to what my future career will entail. Over the course of two weeks I learned just how important communication is when working with peers. I gained a lot of self confidence thanks to this project. Having the opportunity to work on project management and team programming skills has been very informative, and I'm confident I will use these skills again and again on future projects.


# Front End Stories

## Creating a component
For this story I was tasked with creating a webpage.

## Implement a grid system
For this story I utilized Bootstrap to implement a grid on the webpage. Grids are a very useful way to organize your webpage.

## Create a signup form
In story 3 I created form in a modal. First, I created a button that opens the modal created with Bootstrap when clicked. In that modal is the form that a user can interact with. It was a contact form, so it had informational input fields such as name, email, phone number, etc. The form was styled with CSS and Bootstrap.

## Implement form functionality
For story 4, I was assigned to implement form functionality. I used formspree.io to allow the information entered in the form to be sent to an email of my choosing.

## Back to top button
In story 5 I added a button that when clicked on brings the user back to the top of the page. I wrote a Javascript function to create functionality and used CSS to style the button. Add logic statements inside this second function.  If the scroll bar is at the bottom, display the "Back to top" button, otherwise, hide it.

## Creating a toggle button
Story 6 required that I create a toggle button. Typically, toggle buttons are for changing the theme of a webpage. Since my page was technically already a dark theme I chose to instead have the toggle button change the background photo. I used Javascript mostly to create this button. It was a challenge to learn at first, but once I figured it out it was quite simple and I'm glad to have learned something new.

# Other Skills Learned
  - I learned how to use Azure DevOps. When I started the Live Project I had no experience using Azrure at all. It was a slight learning curve. It was very easy to navigate once I got the hang of it.
  - I developed better communications skills during my time in the course. Asking for help can be very hard, but when you're learning how to do something completely new to you it is very important to be able to ask for help.
